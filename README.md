This is a simple little project I did for the codecademy.com Full Stack Engineer career path.  Simply run the script, and it will generate a random silly sentence and print it to the console.

I created this project using Visual Studio Code, tested with Git Bash integrated with Node.js, and pushed it to GitHub using Git Bash.
